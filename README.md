# Programming 1: Personal Programming Practice 9

---

Write a program to solve the following problem. You may discuss and collaborate with your peers, but you should submit your own code and fully understand all code you submit. If you work with others on one of the parts, cite your collaborators in a comment near the top of that file.


The data.csv file contains three columns of data (all numbers). Write a program which inputs this csv into three separate lists (one for each column), computes the max, min, and average of each list, and outputs these to a 4-column csv with row and column headers, forming a table like:

|         | List 1 | List 2 | List 3 |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|   Max   |  ***   |  ***   |  ***   |
|   Min   |  ***   |  ***   |  ***   |
| Average |  ***   |  ***   |  ***   |

*Note: A csv file is a table format storing 1 row per line, with commas separating column elements.*
